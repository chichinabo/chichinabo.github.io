## Usage

This chichinabo app is pretty easy to use and intuitive. However, you can follow these steps:

1. Use the map widget for zooming the area you are interested in. 
2. You always see the area with the biggest population that meet your criteria.
3. Set up the side bar widgets for filtering the database by date, source and different aggregation levels. The result may change.
4. See the pyramid and study it.
5. You can use your mouse's right button on the chart for downloading it as an image file.
6. Go to explore other population pyramids.
