## Usage

This chichinabo app is pretty easy to use and intuitive. However, you can follow these steps:

1. Use the map widget for zooming the area you are interested in. 
2. You always see the 500 top population pyramids that meet your criteria. The icons classify the pyramid shapes in pyramids, stars, bells and tornados.
3. Set up the side bar widgets for filtering the database by date, source and different aggregation levels.
4. Click on the cluster icons to zoom in the area or click on the pyramid icons to see its chart.
5. You can use your mouse's right button on the chart for downloading it as an image file.
6. Go to explore other population pyramids.
